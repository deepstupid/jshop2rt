SHOP2 (see http://www.cs.umd.edu/projects/shop/) is a hierarchical task
network planning algorithm.

The original JSHOP2 project is a high-performance precompiled port of the
SHOP2 LISP implementation.

The JSHOP2-RT branch is a fork of the original JSHOP2 code that contains
optimizations towards real-time planning, primarily intended for use in games.
